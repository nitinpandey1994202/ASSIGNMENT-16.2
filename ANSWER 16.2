QUESTION:-
In many countries, the public telephone network has a single emergency telephone number
(sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services
number) that allows a caller to contact local emergency services for assistance. This emergency
number differs from country to country and typically consists of three digits numbers that can
be easily remembered and dialed quickly. Some countries have a different emergency number
for each of the different emergency services.
